# Shoe Inventory Project


### Description
This program allows user to manage a text based shoe inventory.
It reads the inventory from a file then allows users to search, edit and add new shoes to the inventory.


### Inventory format
The shoe details are stored in a file called `inventory.txt`.
Each line of data represents a shoe, with the following info:

Country - Country of origin
Code - Product code
Product - Project name
Cost - Product cost

When the program launches, it reads in the shoe inventory and creates a list of shoe objects using the Shoe class defined in inventory.py
